Here is a PowerShell script that will remove all groups from multiple disabled users, 
except the "Domain Users" group, and then move all of the disabled users to a new organizational unit:


# Define the list of disabled user accounts
$DisabledUsers = @("5035_kiosk", "Abigail_Rivera")

# Define the new organizational unit
$NewOU = "OU=_DisabledUsers,DC=aspen,DC=com"

# Loop through the list of disabled users
foreach ($User in $DisabledUsers) {

  # Get the user account
  $Account = Get-ADUser -Identity $User -Properties MemberOf

  # Loop through the groups the user is a member of
  foreach ($Group in $Account.MemberOf) {

    # Get the group name
    $GroupName = (Get-ADGroup -Identity $Group).Name

    # Check if the group is not "Domain Users"
    if ($GroupName -ne "Domain Users") {

      # Remove the user from the group
      Remove-ADPrincipalGroupMembership -Identity $User -MemberOf $Group
    }
  }

  # Move the user to the new organizational unit
  Move-ADObject -Identity $Account.DistinguishedName -TargetPath $NewOU
}
