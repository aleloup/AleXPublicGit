This script does the following:

Imports the ActiveDirectory module to access AD cmdlets.
Defines the source and destination OUs using the distinguished name (DN) format.
Gets a list of all disabled users in the source OU using the Get-ADUser cmdlet.
Loops through the list of disabled users and moves each one to the destination OU using the Move-ADObject cmdlet.
Writes a message to the host to confirm that the user has been moved.
Note: Before running this script, you need to replace example.com with your own domain name, and ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify AD objects.
