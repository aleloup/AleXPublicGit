This script first sets the $ou variable to the distinguished name of the target OU. Then it uses the Get-ADUser cmdlet 
to retrieve all users in the specified OU. The ForEach-Object cmdlet is used to iterate through each user, and the 
Set-ADUser cmdlet is used to set the Description field to $null for each user.

Note that you'll need to run this script with administrative privileges and have the Active Directory PowerShell module 
installed on your computer. Also, please make sure to test this script in a non-production environment before running 
it in a production environment to avoid any unintended consequences.

$ou = "OU=TestingforAlex,OU=MIS,OU=Users-HO,OU=Aspen,DC=aspen,DC=com" # Replace with the distinguished name of the target OU
Get-ADUser -Filter * -SearchBase $ou | ForEach-Object {
    $_ | Set-ADUser -Description $null
}
